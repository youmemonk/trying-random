            Dear Eileen,<br><br>

            Thankyou for your recent application to join us at the university of awesome's science faculty to study as a
            part of PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
        </p>

        <h4>Starting Dates</h4>

        <p>
            We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
            you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 september 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 january 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 may 2017</li>
            </ul>

            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

            You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.
        </p>

        <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
        <p>
            At the awesome Science faculty, we have a pretty open minded research facility - as long as the subjects
            fall somwehere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intellegent, dedicated researcher,
            and hust the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were
            most intrigued by are as follows, in the order of priority:

            <ol>
                <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Reserveratol (C14H12O3)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures excedding 30C (86F). when
                    the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 2 x 104.)</li>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>

            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects including how long you'd expect the
            research to take, required stadd and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctoreate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer
            your question. my favourtie dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>

        <p>
            <p>Polynesian Chicken dance</p>
            <div class="tab">
                A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would
                dance
                around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
            </div>

            <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
            <div class="tab">
                Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
                imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this
                dance
                inspired mordern styles such as twerking.
            </div>

            <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
            <div class="tab">
                An interesting example of historic misinformation, English exploreers in the 1960s believed to have
                discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
                inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving
                this like because they were really cold.
